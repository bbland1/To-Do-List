# To-Do-List

Jul 2022

A simple to-do list that is currently deployed with Render [here](https://serene-shore-54412.onrender.com)

- Front-end: EJS
- Back-end: Node
- Database: Mongo Atlas, with Mongoose

Clicking the link above will take you to the home/main list named today. In the new item field new tasked can be filled out and added by clicking the + or hitting enter. Any completed item can then be deleted by marking the checkbox.

For a new list to be made "/list" just needs to be added to the end of the url with the name that you would want that list to be. You will be redirected to that list and can add or delete items the same way as above. In the future you can return to this list by typing the url with the /listName and it will take you to it again.


**Other Notes:**

First usage of EJS, MongoDB, and Mongoose. I really enjoyed using and learning about them all. 

The commits show the process of the intial to-do list with really no functionality to the "final" version. The final version dosn't have the variables to be an active deployment but it could be ran locally with the proper setup if the live deployment wasn't what was needed.

This was a great introduction in creating both the front and back end of an app and getting a database to actually function. There were hiccups in the deployment, integration and just random bugs but it all has seemed to eventually workout with a lot of documentation reading and googling.

The CSS style was imported from the bootcamp I am part of but I updated the color scheme with that chosen on Color Hunt.
